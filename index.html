        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior Computer Science student at Towson University with a
          focus in software engineering. I am passionate about machine learning
          and recently had my first academic research paper accepted for
          publication by IEEE.

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>
              I started learning Python at 11 by reading a beginner Python book
              on coding video games. I've since expanded my knowledge of the
              language, using it for my research on defending machine learning
              models from adversarial attacks.

            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>
              I've been coding in Java for about six years, and it's the
              language I use for most computer science classes. One of the
              larger projects I've used it for was a program that converted the
              words in poetry into music, which I presented at the Maryland
              State Honors conference.

          <div class="go">
            <h3>Go</h3>
            <p>
              I've been learning Go for about one year now. I have yet to do any
              major projects with the language, but I'm excited to learn more.
